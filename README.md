# Sprint Review and Retrospective
 Sprint Review from a college course project that analyzed the agile-scrum lifecycle.

# About
 I learned through the process of agile-scrum that it's extremely important to have constant conversations with the client/user in order to create accurate user stories that I can create a quality project from. I also learned that if I break my project up into small "sprints" that it will help my motivation as I move through the project. I can get frustrated when I feel like a project is taking too long, but changing it into mini projects with successes as I go through the project is a much better way to view it, which is how agile-scrum works as well through the lifecycle of the project. <br><br>
 I learned about being a great team member through this project as well. Being a good team member means constant communication with other team members, and of course working together with those team members. Being respectful is also really important when working with other team members. Quality programming comes from being a quality member of a communicative team.
